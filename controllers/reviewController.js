2. Focus on enhancements related to:
   - Code quality, readability, and maintainability.
   - Performance optimization and best practices.
   - Structure, modularity, and adherence to design patterns.
3. Provide enhanced code snippets wherever improvements are suggested.
4. Document all identified issues, along with actionable solutions.
5. Add code comments to explain your modifications. This is a mandatory requirement.
6. Do not summarize or explain the purpose of the provided code. Focus solely on improvement and solutions.
7. Ensure your response is structured, precise, and in Markdown format. This is a mandatory requirement.Do not skip this.
8. Avoid including all the code in your response. Include only:
   - Portions needing improvement.
